spring framework:
--------------

=> framework s/w is a special s/w that is capable of developing apllicaton based on certain architecutral having the ability to generate common logics of the application dynamically based on other logics supplied by programmer

=> frame work wil be given based on core technologis and framework s/w provides an abstraction layer on core technologies . so that without having strong knowledge on core technologies we can develop core tecnology based application by uisng framweork s/w

=> if you develop applications directly by using core technogologies the common logics of applications and your application specifific logic should be develope by you manually this kills productivity.


=> struts is a framework s/w to develop mvc-2 architecute based web application having the ability to generate integration logic of controller layer dynamically based on the logics given in other layers by programmers

-> spring is framework s/w which can be develop all kind of java/j2ee application in the fremwork style based on dependency injection priniciple

-> servelts and jsp are the core technologies to develop web applications
  ex: struts,jsf, webwork, xwork, spring mvc, and web framework to develop web appliations
      hiberante, top link, ibatis, jdo ,ojb, .etc orm framweork s/w

-> jdbc is the core technologies to develop persistance logic
-> spring framework is developed based on various jse,jee,module based technologies by providing abstraction layer on them. so programmers can use spring s/w to develop all kinds of java/j2ee applications in framework style.

-> spring framework s/w not only provides abstraction layer on java/jee core technologies but also provides abstraction layer on some other framwork s/w like hiberante , toplink etc


plain jdbc code:
--------------'
1. based jdbc driver class and register with drivermanger serive (common operation)
2. establish the connection with db s/w
3. create statments object (common operation)
4. send and execute sql in db s/w 
          ( appplicaiton specific ,requriment based)

5. get and process the results 
         ( applications specific , requirement based)

 6. close connection with db s/w


spring based application:
----------------------

1. get access to jdbc Template that uses jdbc code internally by providing abstraction layer on jdbc technology
2. send and execute sql in db s/w
   (aplication specific logic , requiement based)

3. get and proccess the results
     ( applicaiton speicific , requirement based)


NOte: to observe the spring application code , it is just making the programmer to just develop application specific logic because the jdbc template of spring s/w genearates the remaining common logics dynmaically . this feature makes framework s/w giving good productivity when compare to work with core technologies directly.


-> doing more work in less time having good accuracy is called as good productivity.




=> spring framework is open source
