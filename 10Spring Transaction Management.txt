Transaction Management:
=========================
The process of combining related operations into single unit and executing them by applying do everything or nothing principle called "Transaction Management"

=> the withdraw amount from source account deposite amount from account must happen in Transaction environment
=> in employee registartion employee details insertion into the DB and Insertion inot payroll DB most hppen in transactional environment

  Transaction management allows to implement ACID Properties


A--> Atomocity
C-> Consistency
I--> Isolation
D-> Durability

=> The process of combining indivisible operations into single unit is called Atomocity . Atomicity wor is derived from the term called Atom
=> even thoguh  rules kept  on DB software like balance must not be negative are violated during the course of Transaction management, but if three is  a guarrenty that no rule will be vailated at the end of Transaction management, then we can say DB is    consistent.

=> Applying locks on DB software and allowing one user or one applicaiton at a time to manipulate db data is called isolation.

=> Bringing data back to normal state by log file, backup file eventhough DB is crashed indicates durablity of DB.
